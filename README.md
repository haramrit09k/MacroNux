Macro On Boot GUI for Ubuntu using Quickly GUI Maker, Python and Glade

This is an application developed to allow a Linux user to keep certain programs setup to launch automatically on boot. A software named Quickly GUI was used to develop this application. It makes use of Python to develop native desktop applications for Linux. However, one major downside of Quickly is that it is only compatible with Ubuntu 14.xx and lower. The Quickly GUI maker allows us to efficiently create our desktop application and package it into a .deb file.
